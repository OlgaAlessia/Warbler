# Warbler

This exercise is intended to extend a somewhat-functioning Twitter clone. It is intended to give a practice reading and understanding an existing application, as well as fixing bugs in it, writing tests for it, and extending it with new features.

**Clean & Commit As You Go.**

Treat this exercise like a real code base:

- tidy and document as you go
- check into Git often, as you add new features

Practicing this process will help you as you work on larger codebases.

Also, you may find bugs not mentioned in the app as you explore it. Fix these, and keep a log of what you fixed.
